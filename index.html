                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I believe that everything is possible!! This includes the good, the bad, and the ugly, however,
                    our everything result will be defined by the resources we have to work with and the choices we make
                    in the utilization of those resources.

                    I believe that communication is key and will allow us to reduce the number of obstacles that we face
                    in our professional and personal lives. Being open to change, out-of-the-box thinking, having the
                    willingness to expand boundaries and accept inputs from others increases successful outcomes.

                <p>              
                    Projects are the culmination of vision, ideas, concepts and the ability to bring them all to life. 
                    Participating in many projects, taking on tasks in and out your area of expertise provides an 
                    excellent foundation to increase knowledge and abilities exponentially and rapidly.                     
                                       
                    Being a Consultant working on many projects which also include web development projects such as 
                    B2B, B2C, and internal corporate websites has been an enormous benefit.  As a Full Stack Web
                    Development student I have a limited number of recent projects to display currently. I look forward
                    to displaying more sophisticated project work as I advance through my coursework.
