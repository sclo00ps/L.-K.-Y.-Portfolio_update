                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I believe that everything is possible!! This includes the good, the bad, and the ugly, however,
                    our everything result will be defined by the resources we have to work with and the choices we make
                    in the utilization of those resources.

                    I believe that communication is key and will allow us to reduce the number of obstacles that we face
                    in our professional and personal lives. Being open to change, out-of-the-box thinking, having the
                    willingness to expand boundaries and accept inputs from others increases successful outcomes.

                    As a Technical Consultant, who has provided Project Manager, Product Owner, Scrum Master, Business Analyst, Test Management/Execution
                    and previous Developer services I have an extensive project history.  The projects include Frtune 500 and Fortune 1000 corporate
                    clients in mutltiple industries both domestic and international. The web development projects include B2B, B2C, and internal corporate
                    websites.

                    As a new Full-stack Web Development student I have a limited number of recent projects to display currently, due to my current
                    student status. I look forward to displaying more sophisticated project work as I advance through my coursework.

                <p>
                    I am a Technical Consultant that has provided multiple services to both domestic and international
                    clients. I have provided development, project management, business analysis, testing and
                    validation services in multiple industries.

                    I have made the decision to return to my first love, software development to contribute during
                    these amazing times of technological advancement and creativity which is taking place globally.
