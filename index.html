                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I believe that everything is possible!! This includes the good, the bad, and the ugly, however,
                    our everything result will be defined by the resources we have to work with and the choices we make
                    in the utilization of those resources.

                    I believe that communication is key and will allow us to reduce the number of obstacles that we face
                    in our professional and personal lives. Being open to change, out-of-the-box thinking, having the
                    willingness to expand boundaries and accept inputs from others increases successful outcomes.
